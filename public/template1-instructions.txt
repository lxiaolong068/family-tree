CLASSIC GENEALOGY CHART
=======================

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
-------------------

This Classic Genealogy Chart template is designed to help you document your family history in a traditional, hierarchical format. Follow these steps to create your family tree:

1. GETTING STARTED
   - Start with the oldest known ancestor at the top
   - Work downward through generations
   - Use consistent formatting for dates (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD or MM/DD/YYYY)

2. RECORDING INFORMATION
   - Full name (including maiden names for women with "née" designation)
   - Birth and death dates
   - Locations (birthplace, places lived, burial location)
   - Occupations and notable achievements
   - Marriage dates and spouse information

3. SYMBOLS & FORMATTING
   - Use solid lines to connect parents to children
   - Use dotted lines to show adoptions
   - Males are typically represented with squares/rectangles
   - Females are typically represented with circles/ovals
   - Unknown gender can be represented with diamonds

4. ADDITIONAL TIPS
   - Include sources for your information
   - Add photographs where available
   - Note any uncertainties with question marks
   - Consider color-coding different family branches

This template can be expanded to include as many generations as needed. For very large family trees, consider creating separate sheets for different branches and connecting them with reference numbers.
